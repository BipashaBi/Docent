Also, if the signer uses Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader desktop application, the signer sees a notification that an agreement has \nbeen shared for signing.  \nNote: Signers are not required to sign up or purchase any Adobe product to sign agreements. \nThey can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader \ndesktop application. \nSend in bulk allows you to upload a form and use that as a template to create and send many \n(hundreds!) of unique agreements, each dedicated to one external signer. Each agreement is \ninsulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all \nother recipients. \nThe sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through \nthe Send in bulk template, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status \nof the child agreements created from the template. Additionally, the sender can export the \nfield-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the Download Form Field \nData action. \n \nTo access the Send in bulk feature, do one of the following: \n\u2022 \nIn the Acrobat desktop app, go to the Tools center, scroll down to the E-Sign section, \nand then select Send in bulk. \n\u2022 \nSign in to Acrobat online, select the E-Sign menu in the top navigation bar, and then \nselect Send in bulk. \n",
